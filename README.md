# money-management-app
While i make this app, i wanted to learn things about JSON, LocalStorage and improve my JavaScript skills.

I focused on getting user inputs and listify these inputs as JSON objects on LocalStorage and calculate them.

The design is completly made with my imagination, and i wanted to make it useable on mobile.

You can see the finished state at http://moneymanagement.orgfree.com/ (For the best experience i recommend to use it on Google Chrome).
